I am now a post graduate at USTC (University of Science and Technology of China), majored in software engineering. I have strong interests about IoT and cloud-edge intelligence, I do some research about this, and I want to get a machine learning job after my graduation. As all we know, internet of things will come soon, there will be more and more intelligent devices and it will produce more and more data. I think deep learning is one of the most powerful technics to implement the vision. It can be applied in computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, healthcare and so on. But now i have no enough income to pay for the course. I have only basic living allowance. I have finished 《Neural Networks and Deep Learning》and 《Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization》 which i have paid for $49 by cutting my living expenses. Now i really want to continue this course specification. I will be grateful if I get a scholarship.


Firstly, i have finished the 1th and 2th courses from which i have got a solid foundation about neural networks basics and optimization. I think it is time to apply it to real applications such as computer vision which is very important in intelligent edge devices.
Secondly, if i finished this course, i will get a certificate for my job hunting. Coursera courses are acknowledged by industry. This will be a good point in my resume. It will help me get more opportunities for interviews.
Thirdly, I think this course is very competitive and i will learn more from this course, which will improve my machine learning skills and i will do some research about cloud-edge intelligence more effectively. I believe i will be better at deep learning principle and application which will help me to write thesis and graduation better.
At last, this course specification will lay a solid foundation about deep learning for me. I think it will be the most valuable fortune in my career.
